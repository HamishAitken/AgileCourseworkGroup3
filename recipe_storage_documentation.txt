Currently the recipes are stored in a JSON file, with all of the recipes being there.
The "image" property is a URL to the thumbnail of a recipe.
The "ingredients" property is an array of arrays of ingredient objects, which are a full ingredient description for the recipe (such as "1 clove of garlic") and the ingredient ID (from ingredients.json).
The "preparation_steps" is a Markdown description of the cooking steps

Recipe { 
	id: INT;
	name: string;
	image: string;
	ingredients: [{string, INT}]; 
	preparation_steps: string; 
}

The file looks like this:

{
	"data": {
		recipes: [Recipe]
	}
}

In the future this will probably be changed either to doing the search on the server using a database, which will be more scalable and maintainable, as well as will allow editing the recipes.
 

To store ingredients another JSON file has been created. The file contains a JSON object that has an array of Ingredient objects. Each ingredient is represented by an object that has an "id" field (an integer), a "name" field (a string), an "image" field (a string), and a "store_link" field (a string). As shown below.
It is very similar to the recipe file

Ingredient {
"id": int,
"name": "string",
"image": "string",
"store_link": "string"
}

And the file is:

{
	"data": {
		ingredients: [Ingredient]
	}
}
